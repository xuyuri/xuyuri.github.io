Quake with fear you mortal fools, for Plankton has just stolen this webpage!  What it has to do with the Krabby Patty formula noone knows, but you can either <script TYPE="text/javascript">
emailE=('xywbupt' + '@' + '126.com')
document.write(
 '<A HREF="mailto:' + emailE + '">' 
 + 'report him to me' +'</a>'
)
</SCRIPT> or you could go <A HREF="javascript:history.go(-1)">back</A> to the page you were just viewing.  Just be careful, you never know when that Plankton's going to turn up...
